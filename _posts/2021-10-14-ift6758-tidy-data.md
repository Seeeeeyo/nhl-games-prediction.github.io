## Tidy Data

### Question 1
*Include a small snippet of your final dataframe*


Here are the first 10 rows of our dataframe:
![tidydata](/assets/tidydata.png)

Note that the nan in the *net_empty* come from the fact that we do not have any information about the emptiness of the net when it's a saved shot. We only have access to this data when it's a goal. Therefore, we filled with nan the *net_empty* column for the saved shots. It's the same scenario for the *strength* column.


### Question 2
*Discuss how you could add the actual strength information (i.e. 5 on 4, etc.) to both shots and goals, given the other event types (beyond just shots and goals) and features available.*


By using the events "Penalty" and "penaltySeverity"  we can know when a team has a player in the penalty box.  We could change the "strength field" whenever some of these events happen and revert it back again if the full-time of the penalty has passed before there was any goal or right after a goal is scored in power-play situation. We will need to take into account the particularity of multiple penalties happenning on bothe sides.  From our understanding, there can't be less than 3 skaters on the ice even if the team in question has add more than 2 penalties.


### Question 3
*Discuss some additional features you could consider creating from the data available in this dataset.*


Here are our ideas:
* Define events as counter-attack or not. We could try to determine it by checking if the time interval between a takeaway and a shot.
* We could create the feature *rebound* when the time interval between 2 shots of the same time is smaller than a threshold. 
* We would also like to define the number of players in the offense and defense so we would have a useful extra information for each shot such as: 2 defense players vs 2 attack players. Unfortunately, we don not have enough information to achieve this with the current API.
