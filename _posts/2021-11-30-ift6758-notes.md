## Notes
***Comet ML***


We used different comet projects for this work. Each set of models has its own project. 
However, for clarity, we decided to rerun all the models and log the latest experiments + models in a single project. 
The comet ml links in this blog will lead you to this last project. 

In case you would like to see a full history of our simulations, here is the 
[link](https://www.comet.ml/j-bytes#projects) 
to the workspace with all the different projects.

***Group size***


Please note that our group consist of 3 people, which is less than most of the other groups.
